# Introduction

This project is for SMT 274304.01 â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms.  The intent of the project is to utilize our collective learned knowledge to analyze, plan, implement and test competing Java based coding solutions in order to determine an effective and efficient solution to an existing problem.

### Outline of the Problem
This project is a model representing a simulation of generators which store event logs corresponding to the planned / unplanned outages of the individual units.  In the 'current' system, event data is stored in an array of a fixed length containing informational fields of the event itself, as well as pointers to the predecessor and next available free cell after the current event. The index to the next unassigned free cell is stored and as events are created they are added to that cell and each following next free cell thereafter.

Our project looks to find a more efficient and suitable data structure to store these event logs, while at the same time ensuring that the new system allows for the efficient creation, insertion and searching of event logs.
